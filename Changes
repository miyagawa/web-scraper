Revision history for Perl extension Web::Scraper

0.14  Fri Sep 14 16:06:20 PDT 2007
        - Fix bin/scraper to work with older Term::ReadLine.
          (Thanks to Tina Müller [RT:29079])
        - Now link elements like img@src and a@href are automatically
          converted to absolute URI using the current URI as a base.
          Only effective when you do $s->scrape(URI) or $s->scrape(\$html, URI)
        - Added 'HTML' and its alias 'RAW' to get the HTML chunk inside the tag
            process "script", "code" => 'RAW';
          Handy if you want the raw HTML code inside <script> or <style>.
          (Thanks to charsbar for the suggestion)

0.13  Sun Sep  2 17:11:08 PDT 2007
        - Added 'c' and 'c all' command to scraper to generate the
          code to replay the session
        - Added 'WARN' as a shortcut to sub { warn $_->as_HTML } on scraper shell like:
            process "a", WARN; # print 'a' elements as HTML
        - Added 'search-cpan.pl' and 'rel-tag.pl' to eg/

0.12  Thu Aug 30 02:39:44 PDT 2007
        - Added 's' command to scraper to get the HTML source
        - You can use $tree variable to deal with the HTML::Element object in scraper shell
        - Give a graceful error message if the given Selector/XPath doesn't compile
        - Give a better error when number of args in process() seems wrong

0.11  Tue Aug 28 02:50:01 PDT 2007
        - Supported hash-reference in process values, like
          process "a", "people[]", { link => '@href', name => 'TEXT' };
          See t/09-process_hash.t for its usage.

0.10  Mon Aug 27 00:53:51 PDT 2007
        - result now returns the entire stash if called without keys
        - added bin/scraper CLI

0.09  Wed Aug 15 10:51:14 PDT 2007
        - remove Devel::Leak use from tests

0.08  Tue Aug 14 13:25:16 PDT 2007
        - Call $tree->delete after the callback to avoid memory leaks by TreeBuilder.
          (Thanks to k.daiba for the report)

0.07  Sat May 12 16:23:51 PDT 2007
        - Updated dependencies for HTML::TreeBuilder::XPath

0.06  Sat May 12 15:47:27 PDT 2007
        - Now don't use decoded_content to work with new H::R::Encoding

0.05  Wed May  9 18:21:22 PDT 2007
        - Added (less DSL-ish) Web::Scraper->define(sub { ... }) syntax
        - Fixed bug where the module dies if there's no encoding found in HTTP response headers
        - Added more examples in eg/
        - When we get value using callback, pass HTML::Element object as $_, in addition to $_[0]
          (Suggested by Matt S. Trout)
        - If the expression (1st argument to process()) starts with "/", it's
          treated as a direct XPath and no Selector-to-XPath conversion is done.

0.04  Wed May  9 00:55:32 PDT 2007
        - *API CHANGE* Now scraper {} returns Web::Scraper object and not closure.
          You should call ->scrape() to get the response back.
          (Suggested by Marcus Ramberg)

          I loved the code returning closure, but this is more compatible to
          scrapi.rb API and hopefully less confusing to people.

        - use 'TEXT' rather than 'content' to grab text from element
          to be more compatible with scrapi
        - Added unit tests using Test::Base
        - Refactored internal code for easier reading
        - chained callbacks are now passed HTML::Element, not HTML, to avoid double HTML parsing
        - Implemented callbacks (iterator) API
        - Added 'process_first' to be compatible with scrapi

0.02  Tue May  8 20:03:37 PDT 2007
        - Added dependencies to Makefile.PL

0.01  Tue May  8 04:05:59 2007
